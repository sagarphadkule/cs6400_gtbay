# GTBay - An online auction system

GTBay is a simple online auction site. The site supports two kinds of users: Regular Users and Administrative Users. Both kinds of users can list items they have for sale, search for items, bid on items, rate items, comment on items, and purchase items. Administrative users have the additional option of viewing two administrative reports.

# Purpose of the Project
Analyze, specify, design, implement, document and demonstrate an information system application to support a new online auction system called GTBay. GTBay is similar to, but simpler than, existing online auction sites such as eBay. This system is implemented using a DBMS that supports standard SQL queries.
